\chapter{Introduction}
This document describes the architecture of our “TANK” artillery strategy game for Android developed by Annie Aasen, Mikal Bjerga, Nikola Radenkovic, Jonathan Brusch Nielsen Trapnes and Kjetil Aune. The game takes inspiration from the Worms series. It’s a turn-based multiplayer game where the objective is to hit and destroy the enemy tank with different types of ammo. When the round is over, players can visit the store where they can buy new weapons and tank upgrades. We have decided to use different types of food as ammo.
