\chapter{COTS - Components and Technical Constraints}
We have chosen to use a logic view, development view and process view, as explained in \textit{The “4+1” View Model of Software Architecture} \cite{krutchen}. We have opted not to use the physical view and scenarios from the same paper, as we have deemed them to be unnecessary. The physical view is not needed as we will only use a single device, running a single process, which does not require any documentation to understand. Using the scenario view was discussed, but abandoned, due to the simplicity of our game. If we choose to modify it into a more complex game, e. g. with multiple game modes or different ways of playing the game (e.g online), a scenario view would have to be added to the documentation.
